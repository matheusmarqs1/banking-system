# Banking system
A banking system simulator for a data structure project.

## Goals
This project seeks to work on data structure concepts such as lists, hash tables, stacks and memory management with pointers, while also seeking to implement a real application.

## Contributor List

None of this would have been possible without the collaboration of my colleagues:
* Victor Alves(https://github.com/VictorAlvesk)
